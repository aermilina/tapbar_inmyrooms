### About

# This is a test case for INMYROOMS. I used:

# React

# Typescript

# Sass

# React Hooks

### Goal

# The goal of the project is create a tabbar for mobile version. The tabbar will become hidden when Ð° user scrolls the page more than 200 px one time. Then it appers when a user scrolls up. If users stops scrolling the tabbar (if it was hidden) appers after one second.

# Also I developed a functionality of buttons in the tabbar:

# the first button "Share" opens a share dialog if the browser supports it, if not - just copy the link

# the second button - scrolls the page top

# The third button - increases the number of comments and saves the result to localstorage

# the last one - just increases the number
