# About

This is a test case for INMYROOMS. I used:

- React

- Typescript

- Sass

- React Hooks

## Goal

The goal of the project is create a tabbar for mobile version. The tabbar will become hidden when Ð° user scrolls the page more than 200 px one time. Then it appers when a user scrolls up. If users stops scrolling the tabbar (if it was hidden) appers after one second.

Also I developed a functionality of buttons in the tabbar:

- the first button "Share" opens a share dialog if the browser supports it, if not - just copy the link

- the second button - scrolls the page top

- The third button - increases the number of comments and saves the result to localstorage

- the last one - just increases the number

## Getting Started

After downloading the project use 

```bash 
yarn 
```
to download neseccary node modules

Then 
```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
